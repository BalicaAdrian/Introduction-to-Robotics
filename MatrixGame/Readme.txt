Name of project: Falling Stars
Description: the purpose of the game is to collect the falling stars( the random led which drop down) with your arms( it should be something like  basket)
	     You will have 3 lives. Atfer e perioad of time ( around 7 s) , speed will increase( as a difficult/ level stage). 
	     You lose a life if you miss a falling star. After all 3 lives are gone, you lose . Every time you catch a start your score will be increase.
Hardware: 
	- 8x8 LED Matrix
	-LCD

HOW TO PLAY.
You will have a simple menu with 4 options:
	-start game
	-set level
	-hs which is the highscore
	-info ( a massage sent for you)

After you start the game you will need to collect the fallen stars. There will be a continue drops from the sky.You need to positionate the player under them.
That's how you catch them.
There will be 6 levels ( to 0 to 5). It differs by the speed of the game.
At level 0 you recieve 1 pct, 
   level 1 -> 2 pct
   level 2 -> 3 pct
   level 3 -> 4 pct
   level 4 -> 5 pct
   level 5 -> 6 pct

Also you will have 3 lives to play with !

And for ending, I will leave to you a little secret: the key of the game is to stay how much you can on middle of map to have the ability to run faster to corners.
